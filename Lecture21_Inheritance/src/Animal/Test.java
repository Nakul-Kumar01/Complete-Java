/*
   types of Inheritance:
   1) single
   2) Multiple
   3) heraical

   - Java does not allow multiInheritance bcoz to avoid ambiguity // for this we have interfaces


   super keyword:
   - we can call parent class constructor, parameterised constructor
   - we can call parent class methods


   new
   - object is created in heap memory
   - it is created at runTime not at compile time // Dynamic memory allocation
   - jbb javac krte hn tbb memory nhi milti, java krke run krte hn tbb memory allocate hoti hai


   @Override
   - good practice to write before the method which we are overriding
   - code will work fine without this annotation also
   - but if we use this before our method, then it will give error if the method does not override any parent class method
   - basically it ensures that the method will override any parent class method
